"""self-collab — deterministic translation of the packaged team configuration.

The YAML team relies on the analyst LLM to drive the coder/tester GAN loop via
spawn_agent; here the loop is plain Python, so round caps, never-identical
retries, and stop-on-failed-phase are guaranteed rather than prompted.

Stages: analyze (structured plan) -> parallel plan review (two lenses, one
revision pass when rejected) -> per plan phase, a sequential coder -> tester
loop with the tester's findings folded into the next coder round.

Select with ``--workflow self-collab`` in
``python -m opencollab_eval.generation.gen_prediction_workflow``.

SHARED_RULES = """\
Rules:
- Prefer your DEDICATED tool over bash: file_read/grep to inspect, run_tests \
to test, file_write/apply_patch to edit. Use bash ONLY for what no dedicated \
tool covers (e.g. a one-line `python -c` repro).
- Fix the ROOT CAUSE in the source; make the SMALLEST correct change.
- NEVER edit test files. NEVER run `git commit`; leave edits in the working tree.
- Never assume a package is available: confirm the repo already imports it \
(grep / check the manifest) before using it, and verify your own imports \
resolve before reporting done.
- Keep reports tight: <=8 lines — changed files + what changed, why, and the \
verification result. No preamble or postamble.
- Do NOT grep for a FAIL_TO_PASS test that does not exist yet — the task may \
require creating it; chasing a missing test wastes budget."""
