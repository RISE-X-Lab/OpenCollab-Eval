"""scout-solve — analyze the problem into exploration dimensions, fan those out
to parallel read-only scouts, synthesize their findings into one solution brief,
then solve with a coder/tester loop.

Sibling of ``split_solve.py`` and ``self_collab.py``: same deterministic
GAN-style coder/tester loop, but a different front half. Where ``split_solve``
fans out the *solving* into independent subtasks, ``scout_solve`` fans out the
*understanding* — it pays for breadth of reconnaissance up front so the single
solve loop starts from a confirmed root cause instead of guessing.

Shape:

* the analyst does NOT plan a fix; it decomposes the PROBLEM into independent
  exploration dimensions (distinct angles — origin of the bug, how the subsystem
  works, what the tests/spec expect, who the callers/contracts are, edge cases);
* each dimension is investigated in parallel by a read-only scout that answers
  one focused question with file/line evidence — scouts never edit;
* a synthesizer reconciles every scout report into ONE actionable brief (root
  cause, approach, files, definition of done, watch-outs), confirming anything
  decisive against the source itself;
* a single coder/tester loop solves the goal from that brief, the tester's
  findings folded into the next coder round.

Scouting is read-only, so the parallel fan-out is safe even though every agent
shares one working tree (session ``isolation`` is currently a no-op). Only the
final solve loop mutates files, and it runs sequentially.

Select with ``--workflow scout-solve`` in
``python -m opencollab_eval.generation.gen_prediction_workflow``.

The eval harness can run it unchanged: ``goal`` falls back to the task
``description`` that ``run_eval_task`` passes in its args dict.
