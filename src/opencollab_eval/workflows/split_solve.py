"""split-solve — analyze, split into independent subtasks, solve each with a
coder/tester loop, then synthesize and verify the combined result.

Sibling of ``self_collab.py``, same deterministic GAN-style coder/tester loop,
with three structural differences:

* the analyst splits the goal into INDEPENDENT subtasks (disjoint file sets)
  rather than sequential phases that build on each other;
* a failed subtask never blocks the remaining ones — independence means there
  is no "broken base" to stop on;
* a final synthesizer agent inspects the combined working-tree diff, runs the
  full test suite, repairs integration seams, and reports a structured verdict.

Subtasks still run sequentially: every agent shares ONE working tree (session
``isolation`` is currently a no-op in the factory), so concurrent coders would
race on files and test runs. When worktree isolation lands, the solve loop is
the one spot to parallelize.

Select with ``--workflow split-solve`` in
``python -m opencollab_eval.generation.gen_prediction_workflow``.

The eval harness can run it unchanged: ``goal`` falls back to the task
``description`` that ``run_eval_task`` passes in its args dict.

SHARED_RULES = """\
Rules:
- Prefer your DEDICATED tool over bash: file_read/grep to inspect, run_tests \
to test, file_write/apply_patch to edit. Use bash ONLY for what no dedicated \
tool covers (e.g. a one-line `python -c` repro).
- Fix the ROOT CAUSE in the source; make the SMALLEST correct change.
- NEVER edit test files. NEVER run `git commit`; leave edits in the working tree.
- Never assume a package is available: confirm the repo already imports it \
(grep / check the manifest) before using it, and verify your own imports \
resolve before reporting done.
- Keep reports tight: <=8 lines — changed files + what changed, why, and the \
verification result. No preamble or postamble.
- Do NOT grep for a FAIL_TO_PASS test that does not exist yet — the task may \
require creating it; chasing a missing test wastes budget."""

file set and a concrete, testable definition of done. No subtask may depend \
