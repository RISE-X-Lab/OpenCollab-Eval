The candidate evidence above is a directory of complete saved files. Use
read_candidate_evidence to read each candidate's index and public evidence,
then read the actual diff ranges needed to assess the public requirements.
Each index entry identifies original changed paths, a diff file, and character
offset and length. Large binary patches remain fully available in those files.
Every read returns next_offset and eof; continue reading whenever needed.
Evidence paths are read through the tool, even when the candidate environment
is a separate container. No shell access or candidate modifications are allowed.
Cite original changed paths and inspected diff details in a_evidence and
b_evidence, not the evidence storage paths. File existence or a claimed test
success alone does not establish that a requirement is covered.
