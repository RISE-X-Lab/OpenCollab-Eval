"""analyst-solve hard-gates the tester verdict on the real FAIL_TO_PASS tests
(tester-real-pass).

A tester PASS is only trusted when it carries machine-checkable proof the named
FAIL_TO_PASS node-ids actually ran green: ``failed_count == 0`` AND every
required node-id present in ``tests_run``. Otherwise ``_run_phase`` overrides the
PASS to not-passed and seeds the next round's findings — mirroring the existing
tree-unchanged diff guard. The gate is conditional (D2): it fires only when
FAIL_TO_PASS ids were injected; with an empty list the verdict stands as today.
